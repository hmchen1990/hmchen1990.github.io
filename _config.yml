  Greetings!
  My name is Huaming Chen, currently a Ph.D candidate in University of Wollongong, Australia. I am advised by [A/Prof. Jun Shen](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display/jun_shen), A/Prof. Lei Wang from UoW, A/Prof. Jiangning Song from Monash and Dr. Chi-Hung Chi from CSIRO, Australia.
  I received my Master and Bachelor's degree from Pro. Qingguo Zhou's DSLab and Honors Class at Lanzhou University, in 2015 and 2012 respectively.

  I am interested in the intersection of machine learning and biology systems. A broad area covering from the lower-level computer architecture, such as real-time Linux kernel development, driver development and computer operating systems, to the higher-level algorithms and statistical models including artificial intelligence, machine learning and bioinformatics, has been through my learning and practicing career. Relevant projects and publications can be found attached.
  During my spare time, it is my great pleasure to learn and share with new learning discovery. Details could be found in [my blogs](https://huaming-chen.com/blogs/).
