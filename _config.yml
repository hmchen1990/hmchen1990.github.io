  I am interested in the intersection of machine learning and biology systems. Prior my Ph.D study, I have also been honored to work with Prof. Nicholas Mc Guire in the topic of Linux kernel development, focusing on real-time linux kernel in my master session. I have been fortunate to work with Prof. Hong Zhao in the topic of neural network. All these experience under the supervision of my master supervisor Prof. Qingguo Zhou has benefitted me a lot till now.
  A wide area covering from the lower-level computer architecture, such as real-time Linux kernel development, driver development and computer operating systems, to the higher-level algorithms and statistical models including artificial intelligence, machine learning and bioinformatics, has been through my learning and practicing career. Relevant projects and publications can be found in following details.
