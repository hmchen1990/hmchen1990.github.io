  At this stage, I focus on the topic of software security, especially for AI-enabled systems. Particularly, a call on securing the AI-enabled systems in practice with dedicated software engineering techniques is a brief summary to my current work.
  Generally, I am also passionate in the research areas driven by artificial intelligence (AI for software engineering and science), such as software security, industrial 4.0, computational biology and so on.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
