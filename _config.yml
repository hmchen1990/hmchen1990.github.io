  My name is Huaming Chen. I am currently a researcher under the supervision of Prof. M. Ali Babar in Centre for Research on Engineering Software Technologies, School of Computer Science in University of Adelaide. I received my Ph.D degree from School of Computing and Information Technology in University of Wollongong, Australia. I received my Master and Bachelor degrees from DSLab and Honors Class at Lanzhou University, in 2015 and 2012 respectively.

#  I am interested in the intersection research of machine learning and biology systems. I am honored to be under the supervision of A/Prof. Jun Shen, A/Prof. Lei Wang, A/Prof. Jiangning Song and Dr. Chi-Hung Chi for my Ph.D study, who have given me valuable opportunities in research and help me learning in an expotential growth curve from both machine learning and biology areas. I have been honored to visit NICE group led by Prof. Yaochu Jin in University of Surrey during my Ph.D session.
#  Prior to my Ph.D session, it was my great fortune to work in DSLab leading by Prof. Zhou. I have worked with Prof. Nicholas Mc Guire in the topic of Linux kernel development, focusing on real-time linux kernel, also I have worked with Prof. Hong Zhao in the topic of neural network in the final year of master session.
#  A wide area covering from the lower-level computer architecture, such as real-time Linux kernel development, driver development and computer operating systems, to the higher-level algorithms and statistical models including artificial intelligence, machine learning and bioinformatics, has been through my learning and practicing career. Relevant projects and publications can be found attached.
