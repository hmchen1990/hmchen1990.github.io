The rapid development of high throughput technologies has presented us an opportunity in mining and uncovering the relationships of the biological data. Specifically, the accumulated omics data expose a fundamental scenario for researchers with interest. In this study, we will discuss the topic on drilling computational methodologies to the proteomics study, specifically concerning the interactions between host and pathogens.
